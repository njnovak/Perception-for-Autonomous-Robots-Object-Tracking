To run the files for this project, the following is requreid:
- Python 3.#
- Numpy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Native python libraries

For each file, the appropriate imports and functions should exist. However, if running a file gives you issues, the included ipynb file, [[Tracking_Fitting_Project.ipynb]](https://github.com/njnovak/Perception-for-Autonomous-Robots-Object-Tracking/blob/385b36c863c935fea2388593ae287d95856bec95/Object%20tracking%20and%20surface%20fitting/Tracking_Fitting_Project.ipynb) includes all code in each file. Running this file in its etirety will allow you to resolve any issues that arise running the python files, given that they are independent of your system. Further, the file contains examples of the reuslts presently.

The source .mov and .csv files are included in this folder (ball.mov, pc1.csv, pc2.csv). As such, you should be able to either run each cell in the jupyter notebook or run each python file from terminal as: $Python3 {FILE}.py where {FILE} is the file you selected. They should produce the desired results.

Finally, as a second notice, if ANY errors are encountered from running the python files, please run the corresponding cell in the notebook as a backup as it contains working code. The code in the python files was pulled from this notebook. The python files contain cleaner, more documented code that is easier to understand than the notebook.
