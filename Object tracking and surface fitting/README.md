To run the files for this project, the following is requreid:
- Python 3.#
- Numpy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Native python libraries

Note: Run the Jupyter notebook file 673Project1_notebook.ipynb in lieu of the included python files.

For each file, the appropriate imports and functions should exist. However, if running a file gives you issues, the included ipynb file, [Tracking_Fitting_Project.ipynb] includes all code in each file. Running this file in its etirety will allow you to resolve any issues that arise running the python files, given that they are independent of your system.

The source .mov and .csv files are included in this folder. As such, you should be able to either run each cell in the jupyter notebook or run each python file from terminal as: $Python3 673Project1_#.py where # is the file you selected. They should produce the desired results.

Finally, as a second notice, if ANY errors are encountered from running the python files, please run the corresponding cell in the notebook as a backup as it contains working code. The code in the python files was pulled from this notebook. The python files contain clean, documented code that is easier to understand than the notebook.
